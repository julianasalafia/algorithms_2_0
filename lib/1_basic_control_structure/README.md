## 01 - BASIC SEQUENCES

**1)** Write a program that displays the message "*Hello, World!*" on the screen.

**2)** Create a program that reads a person's name and displays a welcome message to them.
*Ex: What's your name? John Doe. Hello John Doe, nice to meet you!*

**3)** Create a program that reads a employee's name and salary, displaying a message in the end.
*Ex: Employee Name: Mary Smith. Salary: US$1850.45. Employee Mary Smith has a salary of US$1850.45 in June.*

**4)** Develop an algorithm that reads two integers and displays their sum.
*Ex: Enter a value: 8. Enter another value: 5. The sum between 8 and 5 is equal to 13.*

**5)** Create a program that reads a student's two grades in a subject and displays their average.
*Ex: Grade 1: 4.5. Grade 2: 8.5. The average between 4.5 and 8.5 is equal to 6.5.*

**6)** Create a program that reads an integer and displays its predecessor and successor.
*Ex: Enter a number: 9. The predecessor of 9 is 8. The successor of 9 is 10.*

**7)** Develop an algorithm that reads a real number and displays its double and third.
*Ex: Enter a number: 3.5. The double of 3.5 is 7.0. The third part of 3.5 is 1.16666.*

**8)** Create a program that reads a distance in meters and shows the relative values in other measurements.
*Ex: Enter a distance in meters: 185.72. The distance of 85.7m corresponds to: 0.18572km. 1.8572hm. 18.572dam. 1857.2dm. 18572.0cm. 185720.0mm.*

**9)** Create an algorithm that reads how much money a person has in their wallet (in R$) and shows how many dollars they can buy. Consider US$1.00 = R$3.45.

**10)** Create an algorithm that reads the width and height of a wall, calculates and shows the area to be painted and the amount of paint needed for the job, knowing that each liter of paint paints an area of ​​2 square meters.

**11)** Develop a logic that reads the values ​​of A, B, and C from a second-degree equation and shows the value of Delta.

**12)** Create a program that reads the price of a product, calculates, and shows its PROMOTIONAL PRICE, with a 5% discount.

**13)** Create an algorithm that reads an employee's salary, calculates, and shows their new salary, with a 15% increase.

**14)** The car rental company needs your help to charge for their services. Write a program that asks for the number of kilometers traveled by a rented car and the number of days it was rented for. Calculate the total price to be paid, knowing that the car costs $90 per day and $0.20 per kilometer traveled.

**15)** Create a program that reads the number of days worked in a month and shows an employee's salary, knowing that they work 8 hours a day and earn $25 per hour worked.

**16)** ***[CHALLENGE]*** Write a program to calculate a smoker's reduced lifespan. Ask for the number of cigarettes smoked per day and how many years they have smoked. Consider that a smoker loses 10 minutes of life for each cigarette. Calculate how many days of life a smoker will lose and display the total in days.
